the original template I used is the first one on the site:
https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp

it doesn't use bootstrap but I thought I would at first so I still included it. Adam said he wanted photo slideshow and map showing location(it's just a picture rn), which are not added yet.
